# Introduction

### Welcome to the style guide for AskAnna components and design.

The design language of AskAnna's components is based on a combination of [ Vuetify's](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/introduction/why-vuetify/) Material Design components and [ Tailwind CSS's](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first) utility-first approach. This means that we prioritize functionality, ease of use, and accessibility, while also providing a visually appealing and consistent experience across the project's components.

In this style guide, you'll find guidelines for the use of Vuetify and Tailwind CSS components, including typography, color, spacing, layout, and more. These guidelines are designed to provide a clear and consistent design language that can be used across the entire project. Additionally, we've provided resources such as color palettes, typography sets, and sample layouts to help you quickly and easily create beautiful interfaces using these components.
